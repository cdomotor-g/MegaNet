-- 0029_station_elevation_source.sql — Where a station's height came from, so a
-- modelled one cannot be read as a surveyed one.
--
-- Why this file exists
-- ────────────────────
-- 840 of the 3,174 stations carry an `elevation_ahd`. The other 2,334 carry
-- nothing, and link-budget.js and path-profile.js fall back to a ~30 m terrarium
-- tile for those ends — a height above the EGM96 geoid, which is not the datum
-- every other height in this file is in.
--
-- #198 closed that gap: Geoscience Australia / ICSM's Elvis platform answers in
-- AHD off the best model the nation holds at a point, and over this station list
-- that is finer than 30 m under 70.8% of them — 1 m under 1,608, 50 cm under
-- 337. `data/elvis/elvis-fill.csv` carries a figure for 2,333 of the 2,334.
--
-- Writing those into `elevation_ahd` alone would be a quiet loss. That column
-- has always meant *surveyed*: the station card renders it plainly as `X m AHD`,
-- and the "modelled" row added in #198 renders only where the column is null.
-- Fill the column and 2,333 modelled heights start reading as survey marks, and
-- the distinction disappears in the same stroke that created the need for it.
--
-- So the height and its provenance are separate. `elevation_ahd` keeps meaning
-- "a height in AHD"; `elevation_source` answers "where did this number come
-- from" — null for a surveyed one, and for a modelled one the provenance in
-- words, e.g. `Elvis 1 m (QLD Government)`. One column and a display string
-- rather than a parsed code, because it is provenance and not a key: the card
-- shows it as it stands, and the per-station dataset filename stays in the
-- committed CSV for anyone auditing a figure.
--
-- Nothing that reads `elevation_ahd` today has to change to stay correct.
--
-- What this file does NOT do
-- ──────────────────────────
-- It carries no station data. The 2,330 heights (2,333 less three skipped, see
-- below) live in `stations.json` and reach the tables the way every other
-- station edit does — `tools/import_stations_json.py`, which upserts the file
-- and is idempotent down to `updated_at`. A migration carrying 2,330 rows would
-- be a second copy of the document, free to drift from the first.
--
-- Three stations are deliberately left with no height: `busselton_jetty`,
-- `lochsport_marina` and `port_phillip_bay_st_kilda_marina` come back as exactly
-- 0.00 m from SRTM, which is its sea-surface value over water rather than a
-- measurement of ground. They keep falling back to the tile, which is no worse
-- than before. The eighteen genuinely sub-zero values are kept: they are tide,
-- wharf and bar gauges, and -1.29 m AHD at `brisbane_bar_tide_tm` is correct.
--
-- What had to be restated
-- ───────────────────────
-- `meganet.station_json` builds its object from an explicit key list, so a new
-- column is invisible until the view says its name. `meganet.stations_json`
-- needs nothing — it aggregates `doc` out of `station_json` — but the two write
-- paths do: `save_station()` (the editor) and `load_stations_doc()` (the
-- importer). The restatements below are those three objects verbatim from
-- 0027/0024 with the one key threaded through.
--
-- One of those edits is easy to miss and silent when missed: the
-- `is distinct from` pair at the end of `load_stations_doc()` is what decides
-- whether a row actually changed. `elevation_source` is added to *both* halves
-- in the same position — leave it out of either and a re-import that set only
-- the provenance would read as "nothing changed" and be skipped.
--
-- No grants are repeated with the restatements, which is deliberate and matches
-- what 0027 and 0024 did with the same two functions. db/README.md's rule — a
-- function that writes has its EXECUTE revoked from `public` in the same file —
-- is about a function being *created*. `create or replace` leaves an existing
-- function's ownership and privileges alone, so 0003's and 0004's revokes still
-- stand; repeating them here would imply they had been lost.
--
-- Idempotent and forward-only, per db/README.md.
